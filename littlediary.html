        <div class="description-1"><h3>Why I created this project</h3>
            <p>This is based on a project I crafted along with a Udemy Web Development Course.
                I wanted to take what I learned and expand on it, adding more functionality. I have transformed
            the UI and I am working on adding database functionality to be able to persist the data, as well as edit and delete posts. I plan on
        using MongoDB, because I have not yet had experience implementing a Non- Relational Database.</p></div>
        <div class="description-2"><h3>How I created this project</h3>
            <p>I created this project with Node.js and Express.js. I also used EJS for templating.</p</div>
        <div class="description-3"><h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>I havent had any challenges yet, but I can forsee that impelementing the edit and delete functionalities 
            would be challenging for me. I am still getting used to programming server-side, setting up routes, etc.
        </p></div>
        <div class="description-4">
          <h3>How I want to improve this project</h3>
          <p>As mentioned I want to add edit and delete functionalities as well as improve the UI design with more custom style.
          </p>

          <h3>Notes</h3>
          <p>Clicking the user profile icon displays a menu. 'Add New Entry' functionality does work.
            click 'Add New Entry' button to create a sample entry and see the results.
