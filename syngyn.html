        <div class="description-1"><h3>Why I created this project</h3>
            <p>I created this project to practice working with API's. I researched
                some cool API's and decided I wanted to build 
                something that I would want to use in my everyday life. I often
            look up synonyms to expand my vocabulary when writing , so I chose
        to build a synonym generator to cut out the google search middle man.  </p</div>
        <div class="description-2"><h3>How I created this project</h3>
            <p> This is a React app utilizing Axios to consume the WordsAPI. </p></div>
        <div class="description-3"><h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>The most challenging part of this project was reading the documentation of the WordsAPI, and
            learning how to make the request with Axios. 
        </p></div>
        <div class="description-4">
          <h3>How I want to improve this project</h3>
          <p>I think I could experiement with the design of the UI a bit more, but other
              than that this was meant to be a simple application. Any added complexities would be 
            changing the app's main purpose and functionality. </p>
