        <div class="description-1"><h3>Why I created this project</h3>
            <p>I was asked to build a website for a new Speech Clinic with WordPress
                and I was more than happy to do it. </p</div>
        <div class="description-2"><h3>How I created this project</h3>
            <p>The first iteration of the site I coded with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap. This proved
                to be quite tedious as essentially I was creating a WordPress Theme from scratch, which
            required the use of PHP. However, I decided I wanted the website to be simple to 
        update if the client wanted to make any changes on their own. So, I chose to revamp
    the website using the Elementor plugin / page builder. This streamlined my workflow, design
and now the website is way easier to edit and update. </p></div>
        <div class="description-3"><h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>The most challenging part of this project was learning PHP as it relates to WordPress.
            Learning Elementor was quite simple, but creating a new theme without touching the old one
            was a challenge as well. I ended up developing the new theme locally, as to not disturb the previous
            website while the new design was under construction.
        </p></div>
        <div class="description-4">
          <h3>How I want to improve this project</h3>
          <p>The client wants to eventually add an online shop to the website,
              which will be a new challenge for me. I'm sure I will be introduced to
              WooCommerce and all of the learning that comes with building an ecommerce site.
