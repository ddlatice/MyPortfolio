            <p>I am very bad at remembering birthdays - always have been. I have written
                birthdays in my calendar to no avail. And birthdays are tricky. Even
            if you remember one, there's another one coming up quick. It keeps you on your toes.
        I knew I wanted to create an app to help me with this problem. </p></div>
        <div class="description-2"><h3>How I created this project</h3>
            <p>This is a React app styled with Material-UI. </p></div>
        <div class="description-3"><h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>The most challenging part of this project was implementing the functionality of
            the app notifying you of how many birthdays are upcoming in the next 30 days. I learned alot
            about React Context API, and was able to get used to how data is passed through
            React applications.
        </p></div>
        <div class="description-4">
          <h3>How I want to improve this project</h3>
          <p>I have already implemented LocalStorage to persist my data, which is enough complexity for this application. But I could implement different features
              per entry. For example, adding a text area in case you want to make
              a quick note of what gift to buy that person, etc.
