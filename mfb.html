        <div class="description-1"><h3>Why I created this project</h3>
            <p>This project was an original idea of mine that first blossomed when I was taking
              a Mobile Application Development course at Auburn. My final project for that class was to 
            create this project in Swift (the presentation for that final project can be watched on my home page!). I really enjoyed it, and 
          recieved great feedback on how much effort I put into the project. I decided to try to make a Web App version
        just for fun. </p</div>
        <div class="description-2"><h3>How I created this project</h3>
            <p>I created this project with HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL. </p></div>
        <div class="description-3"><h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>The most challenging parts of this project was learning PHP. During my time at Auburn,
          we did not get any experience with PHP, and we only scratched the surface of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
          I have spent alot of time essentially teaching myself Front End basics. This project was
          my first real introduction to PHP. I did, however, have experience with SQL databases in school. What helped was
          having my main functionalities in mind and using the amazing internet to help me put the pieces together and create this app.
        </p></div>
        <div class="description-4">
          <h3>How I want to improve this project</h3>
          <p>I created this project to flesh out an idea and get experience with a new language. I did temporarily deploy to Heroku and integrate ClearDB for the learning experience and to record a demo, but the app is not yet complete.
            I definitely want to learn more about PHP, PHP security, and add more input validation and error handling to the project. In the future I would love to deploy
            a completed version for my family and friends to use.  I would also like to improve the UI. I'm always looking for ways to improve a project
            visually, because I like to use apps that I find attractive and fun. </p>
